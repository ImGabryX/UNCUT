# UNCUT
Game UNCUT made with the framework Phaser3 and TypeScript https://phaser.io/phaser3

This game has been developed by 7 guys (me included) in a weekend for a competition called Phaser Game Jam in Italy, Baronissi(SA) and is inspired by the dinosaur game made by google.
The theme of the competition was "GREEN".
The main objective of the game is to stop illegal forests who cut wood and destroy their pick-up. At the same time they will start to throw you wood,axes and chainsaws.

If you want to save the forest you must destory it and also to stay alive you must JUMP THE WOOD, SLIDE UNDER THE AXES and HIT THE CHAINSAWS.

Its a bit difficulty, you must be in time to hit the chainsaw which is the most difficult part of the game, i can also add more stages to it, give me your opinion.
